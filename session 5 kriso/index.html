        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> After obtaining an agent at age six, Knightley began working in commercials and small television roles. Her
            first onscreen appearance was in the 1993 Screen One television episode titled "Royal Celebration". She then
            played Natasha Jordan, a young girl whose mother is involved in an extramarital affair, in the romantic
            drama A Village Affair (1995). After appearing in a spate of television films through the mid-to-late 1990s,
            including Innocent Lies (1995), The Treasure Seekers (1996), Coming Home (1998), and Oliver Twist
            (1999),[16] Knightley landed the role of Sabé, Padmé Amidala's handmaiden and decoy, in the 1999 science
            fiction blockbuster Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace. Her dialogue was dubbed over by Natalie
            Portman, who played Padmé. Knightley was cast in the role because of her close resemblance to Portman; even
            the two actresses' mothers had difficulty telling their daughters apart when they were in full make-up.[17]

            In her first major role, the 2001 Walt Disney Productions television film Princess of Thieves, Knightley
            played the daughter of Robin Hood. In preparation for the part, she trained for several weeks in archery,
            fencing, and riding.[18] Concurrently, she appeared in The Hole, a thriller that received a direct-to-video
            release in the US. The film's director Nick Hamm described her as "a young version of Julie Christie".[19]
            Knightley also took on the role of Lara Antipova in the 2002 miniseries adaptation of Doctor Zhivago, to
            positive reviews and high ratings.[20] In the same year, Knightley starred as a pregnant drug addict in
            Gillies MacKinnon's drama film Pure. Co-starring Molly Parker and Harry Eden, the film had its world
            premiere at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival.[21] In a retrospect review for AboutFilm.com,
            Carlo Cavagna noted Knightley's screen presence and wrote that "[although Knightley] doesn't have half of
            Parker's ability [...] she has spunk and grit [and] shines brightly in Pure".[22]

            Knightley landed a breakthrough role when she starred in Gurinder Chadha's sports comedy film Bend It Like
            Beckham, which was a box office hit in the U.K and U.S.[23] Knightley portrayed Jules, a tomboy football
            player struggling against social norms who convinces her friend to pursue the sport.[24] The film surprised
            critics who were laudatory of its "charming" and "inspiring" nature, social context and the cast's
            performances.[25] Knightley and her co-star Parminder Nagra attracted international attention for their
            performances;[26] critic James Berardinelli, who was largely laudatory of the film and the "energetic and
            likable" cast, noted that Knightley and Nagra brought "a lot of spirit to their instantly likable
            characters".[27] To prepare for their roles, they underwent three months of extensive football training
            under the English football coach Simon Clifford. Knightley was initially sceptical of the project: in an
            interview with Tracy Smith she said, "I remember telling friends I was doing this girls' soccer movie [...]
            And nobody thought that it was gonna be any good."[28]</p>
